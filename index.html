		<p>I am a self-taught programming noob with an interest in game development. This website<br>
		will serve to teach me web development while displaying some of my projects. I am returning to<br>
		replace the former placeholder text in this paragraph before googling how to put this garbage on github.</p>

			<p>OKAY, I finally got a manual save and revised my save system to now support, get this: MULTIPLE SAVES FOR THE SAME CHARACTER.<br>
			Yeah, yeah, should have done that to start. What can I say, my priorities suck.<br>
			So, I definitely want to have all npc interaction data and player reactions tracked on<br>
			the one save file. That'll be.....fun. I'll figure it out. Anyways, here is pretty save system.<br>

			<p>Need to properly list available saves. I've written the code, broke stuff, commented it out<br>
			as it wasn't technically essential, and now tbh I don't even know if it still exists. Easy<br>
			to do, though. Anyways, peace(I feel like I need an outro).<br>

		should know that I don't care enough to implement a decent looking bottom<br>
		margin for this website right now. LEAVE ME ALONE.</p>
