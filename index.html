		<p>I am a self-taught programming noob with an interest in game development. This website<br>
		will serve to teach me web development while displaying some of my projects. I am returning to<br>

				The Creation of Slay The Orc King
			</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p id="STOK_DEVLOG_INTRO">
			Slay The Orc King is a WIP text-based adventure rpg created by yours truly<br>
			for the primary purpose of teaching myself C++. Ironically, I'm unlikely to<br>
			use this knowledge for its originally intended purpose because while I <br>
			planned to rebuild a WIP Unity game of mine in Unreal, I'm now considering<br>
			scrapping that entirely and going back to Unity with C#(because Unreal is not ideal<br>
			for 2-Dimensional games). I find a certain charm in text-based games,<br>
			perhaps their simplicity, or their ability to easily represent scenarios<br>
			that would otherwise be rather difficult to produce. This is the development<br>
			log of Slay The Orc King(I did NOT in fact begin this devlog at the start of<br>
			the actual development. SUE ME.)
		</p>
		<h3> 4/24 </h3>
		<p> Today I cleaned up a lot of code and got my save(sort of)working.</p>
		<img src="Images/4_2025/4_24_git.png" alt="Git Hub Commits" width="400"></img>
		<p> But before I delve into that, I should probably explain what I have managed to implement thus far.</p>
		<img src="Images/4_2025/4_24_f01.png" alt='"An IDE console outputting "Welcome to Slay The Orc King"' width="400"</img>
		<div id="post"> <p>This player name prompt is essential to the load process.<br>
		After the player inputs their name, the program will check for a player save file<br>
		of that name, create it if it does not exist, and set player stats and room number<br>
		to the information in that file. THIS IS SADLY CASE-SENSITIVE FOR NOW, SUE ME.<br>
		Very basic stuff here, but this was actually quite<br>
		difficult for me to create, involving an undoubtedly ineffecient series of opening<br>
		and closing input and output filestreams. One great thing about creating a text-based<br>
		game like this is its going to run practically instantly anyways so optimization is<br>
		not a great concern of mine.</p>
		<img src="Images/4_2025/24_f02.png" alt="Console with player input 'north' and 'south'"</img>
		<p>Here we see some basic room-to-room movement. Again, all player input is case-<br>
		sensitive, will fix EVENTUALLY(probably).<br>
		Originally, I wanted to give each room an x and y value, creating a coordinate system,<br>
		but this doesn't really work well with secret rooms or, you know, MOVING DIAGONALLY,<br>
		so I went with a simple room number system. Don't re-invent the wheel, right?</p>
		<img src="Images/4_2025/24_f04.png" alt="C++ snippet"></img>
		<p>Here we see the actual room logic, which used to look VERY BAD(you'll see in a bit).<br>
		if (getPlayerInput(playerInput)) basically checks to see if the player's input is general<br>
		(help, quit, etc., non-room-specific commands)and if it is, it returns the room input function<br>
		early. If the game receives room-specific input or an invalid command, it continues as normal.</p>
		<img src="Images/4_2025/24_f03.png" alt="SlayTheOrcKing.cpp snippet"></img>
		<p>Using a map was actually copilot's idea(seeing as I didn't even know what a map<br>
		was at the time), but don't worry, I'm not just mindlessly copy-pasting here, <br>
		rather I took the time to actually learn how this code works before implementing it.<br>
		I use copilot a lot for debugging. When it comes to feature implemenation, I want to<br>
		at least learn something and not just add code that I don't even understand.<br>
		That said, this works quite well.</p>
		<img src="Images/4_2025/24_f05.png" alt="VERY BAD CODE"></img>
		<p>When I say I "cleaned up" my code I mean I took a hyper-nested abomination<br>
		and made it slightly more tolerable. Just look at this room logic prior to denesting.<br>
		This is part of an ongoing effort to clean and beautify my code. What you just witnessed is FAR<br>
		from the worst nesting in my code. You absolutely do NOT want to see how bad it gets. Of course,<br>
		I'm going to show you anyways...in the next devlog(maybe, my priorities tend to get jumbled).</p>

			<h3> 4/25 </h3>
			<p> I don't plan on these logs being daily, but this demands its own log. I said in<br>
			my first log that I had an inefficient load system. Well, I made it more efficient.<br>
			Below is the old code, WARNING: NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.</p>
			<img src="Images/4_2025/25_f01.png" alt="HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CODE"></img>
			<img src="Images/4_2025/25_f03.png" alt="MORE TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD CODE"></img>
			<p>What you are looking at is quite possibly the worst code I have ever written.<br>
			Prior to setting up a save functionality in PlayerController.cpp, I would try to<br>
			open an ifstream at the target player save file, creating an fstream if that<br>
			file did not exist. I then closed the fstream, got the player room number<br>
			from the script with a the ifstream, closed the ifstream, opened an ofstream,<br>
			REWROTE THE PLAYERNAME AND PLAYER ROOM, finally passing this information to<br>
			the player controller script. But after creating the save functionality on<br>
			my player controller, I realized I can do all this SO MUCH EASIER IN THAT SCRIPT<br>
			without having to open and close all those i/o/fstreams in SlayTheOrcKing.cpp.</p>
			<p>Seeing as, at this point, I had now given PlayerController.cpp the ability<br>
			to create an ifstream, read it, set player stats to the data in that file,<br>
			and also write player stats to it through an ofstream, I had almost<br>
			everything in place already to make this work without all the awful code<br>
			you just saw. I simply declared my PlayerController playerController()<br>
			constructor a bit earlier and write a few lines that honestly I already<br>
			forgot while writing this post. I no longer needed to read player room<br>
			from SlayTheOrcKing.cpp as I had already set this up while creating the<br>
			save method in PlayerController.cpp. I honestly feel a little dizzy typing<br>
			all this in VIM right now. VIM is cool but it makes my head hurt a bit.<br>
			I've been writing my game in eclipse, and learning VIM with my webdev.<br>
			I'm weird like that, I guess. Anyways, below is better code. (Yes, I<br>
			know directly setting player to playerName from here is redundant,<br>
			I JUST SAW THAT WHILE WRITING THIS, SUE ME.</p>

		<p id="end"> This is the end of my website. If you have read this far, you<br>
		should know that I don't care enough to implement a decent looking bottom<br>
		margin for this website right now. LEAVE ME ALONE.</p>
