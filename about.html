		<h1> About </h1>
		<p>I really started getting into game development with my still-unfinished bullet-hell<br>
		project, Pseudo-Zealous. Will likely start devlogging it once I actually lock in.<br>
		It has not been my primary focus recently, but I plan to finish it by the end of 2025.<br>
		The graphical side of the project has been taken over by my little brother. I am also<br>
		solo-developing(for now, anyways)a text-based adventure rpg called Slay The Orc King(STOK).</p>
		<p>I have also produced a bare-bones app to automate posting to this website. Affecionately<br>
		called "cppost"(a concatenation of C++, the language it is written in, and 'post'"), it<br>
		currently only supports h3, img, and p tags, and only p tags can be styled from<br>
		within the program, but I will expand it eventually. This, as well as STOK, are completely<br>
		open-source, avaiable on my <a class="inL-a" href="https://github.com/bruce835">github.</a></p>
		<h2> Future Plans </h2>
		<p>As 99% of my coding experience is with C# and C++, I'm curious about procedural and<br>
		especially functional programming. I honestly think object-oriented programming is kind<br>
		of dumb, or at least the extreme that many take it to. I want to mess around with rust<br>
		and maybe haskell. Not a functional language, but I might learn some java as well. I want<br>
		to create a storage manager app for my sister's cookie business, and I want to see where I<br>
		can take indie gave development. So, this has been me. Peace.</p>
